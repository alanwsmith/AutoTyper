# AutoTyper For Mac

This app automatically types the contents of
a text script into an app. It's goal is to make it
easier to make screen recordings where typing
is necessary. Instead of doing it manually, 
the app will do it for you. Faster and without 
flubbing keys.

## Installation

- Download the AutoTyper.zip file. Unzip it
and copy the AutoTyper.app file to your
Applications folder. 

## Usage

- Documentation and examples are included
in the app itself. 

## Notes

- This is my first SwiftUI macOS app. There's
lots about the code that feels pretty hacky, 
but it works. 

- The app works on macOS 14.x. I'm not currently 
set up to test other versions. 

- The app was built on a U.S. keyboard. I'm not
currently set up to test other keyboards. I 
think there will be some work to do to get 
other character sets to work. I don't know
enough about that yet to know what to expect
or what would need to be done.
