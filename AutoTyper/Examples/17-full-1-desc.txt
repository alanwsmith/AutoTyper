This is more of a "real-world" example showing the basics of how I've been using the app. I create a new, empty example.py file and save it in VS Code so it sets the file type then run the AutoTyper script. It then does everything including running the file in the debugger. 

Note that the first few lines clear the file of any existing content which makes it easy to re-run as I'm working on AutoTyper's script.
