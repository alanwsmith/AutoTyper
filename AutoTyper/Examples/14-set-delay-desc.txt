The 'set-delay: NUMBER' and 'set-delay: MIN: MAX' commands change the typing delay between characters. 

The default delay is set up to produce a random delay between 0.01 and 0.03 seconds. Changing these minimum and maximum for the random value is done with 'set-delay: MIN: MAX' like:

set-delay: 0.05: 0.09

The 'set-delay: NUMBER' version (i.e. the one with only a single NUMBER instead of two) removes the randomness and does the exact same delay for everything. For example:

set-delay: 0.1
