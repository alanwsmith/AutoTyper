The 'type-line: TEXT' command is a shortcut to adding text and entering a newline after it. For example, doing this:

type-line: Hello, World!

is the same as doing:

type: Hello, World!
newline

This was the original shortcut but I don't use it as much anymore. Instead, I generally use 'type-down: TEXT' (which we'll see in the next example). By prepping a file with multiple empty newlines it can help prevent scroll bars in apps like VS Code from flashing.
