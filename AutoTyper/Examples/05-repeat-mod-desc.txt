The 'repeat: NUMBER: MODIFIERS: KEY' command works just 'press: MODIFIERS: KEY' command but with the addition of NUMBER to determine how many times the key should be pressed. 

For example, this 'press: MODIFIERS: KEY' command presses Option + left-arrow once:

press: option: left-arrow

And this 'repeat: NUMBER: MODIFIERS: KEY' command presses Option + left-arrow five times:

repeat: 5: option: left-arrow
