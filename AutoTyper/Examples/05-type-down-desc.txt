The 'type-down:' command types out what it's given then presses the down arrow instead of the return/enter key to create a newline. 

The command is designed to work a file that already has empty lines in it. 

The way I set that up is to do something like 'newline: 50' to create the lines, then 'press: command: up-arrow' to go to the top of the file. 

I added this feature to help reduce the amount of flashing the scrollbar does in VS Code and similar apps. 

Specifically, the default version of VS Code at the time I'm making AutoTyper flashes the scrollbar every time a new line is added with the 'type-line:' command. 

Using 'type-down:' with a file that's already set up with newlines prevents the flash and reduces the visual movement to just the line marker moving. 

(This example also uses 'pause:' which we'll look at in the next example)
