The 'type:' command types out whatever you feed it and nothing more.

Specifically, it doesn't add any newlines when it finishes typing your content. We'll see in later examples how this makes it useful for editing content in the middle of a line.

The 'type:' command accepts standard letters, numbers, and symbols from a standard U.S. keyboard either with or without the Shift key being pressed. I haven't tested on international keyboards yet. I don't know how they'll behave. 

You'll need to use the 'press:' command (show further below) if you want to type a character that requires holding Command, Control, or Option.
