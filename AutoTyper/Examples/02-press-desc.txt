The 'press:' command is used for single key presses. It's the same as pressing the given key on the keyboard without any "modifier" keys (i.e. command, control, option, or shift) being held.

The example shows how the 'left-arrow' is pressed multiple times to move the cursor into position to type the "W" that was left off of "World" on the first pass. 

The Command, Control, Option, and Shift modifier keys can be added to a 'press:' as well by placing them before the key to be pressed. 

The example shows how typing a capital "W" with the 'press:' command requires adding 'shift:' to produce the line 'press: shift: w'
